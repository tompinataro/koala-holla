Koalas Deserve Better!

===========

Our client, Koala Holla (1976 Llama Comma Drive, Walla Walla WA) is a non-profit dedicated to the ethical transitioning of koalas from the outdoors (whereupon they may be rained) to urban areas where roofs exist. Your team has been hired to build a web app to handle their terrarium residents.
